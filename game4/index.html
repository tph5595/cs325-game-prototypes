			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> REverse tetris/stack as high as you can games

			</li>

			<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> Stack to the top and stop the sun from melting your ice cubes
			</li>

			</li>

			<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> I have not made a stacking game yet
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> see if the concept is too demanding
			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> high addrenaline rush and wanting to push fora faster and faster times
			</li>

			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> players use the arrow keys to move around and asdf to put up sheilds. the sun melts the top ice if the shield is not up and teleports aroudn the map
			</li>

			<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> focus. a lot.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> Its a hot day at the beach. get enough ice to cool off but make sure you shield it from the hot sun or it will melt.

			<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>I am tryign to reach highly competitive people aroudn the age of 15-22 who already play video games on the regular and are looking for a new challenge.
			</li>
