    <h2>Your game title</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Originality:</strong> There are no games on the market where you can have your mouse be chased by the berst buy logo
      </li>

      <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> The logo is moving as if on ice becasue it takes a little to change direction
      </li>

      <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong> Scaling the objkect was hard but phaser is super fun ! i love it! yaaaaaaa.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> I stole my assets from online
        <ul>
          <li>sound: <a href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/little-idea">this guy</a></li>
          <li>logo: <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/">best buy</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>The template and examples on phaser are the closet to my game.
      </li>

      <li><strong>High Concept:</strong> Fear for your life as the bestbuy logo chases you.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Grandmas ashes made me want to make a horror game. so i made this game.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> How scary can you make a game, where does the line lie.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Feasr for life, question the world aroudnt them
      </li>

      <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe
        game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
      </li>

      <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory,
        mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
      </li>

      <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
      </li>
