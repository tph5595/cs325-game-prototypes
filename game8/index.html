		<h2>All Aboard!</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Originality:</strong> I modified a lot of the graphics from base templates i found online. The other originality that i added is that i do not know of a kids shape matching game. i think this fun use of a train and fun sounds will get them playing and learning. i know it would for me!
				kids.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> I focused on the design aspect. I also tried to balance the childs learning patterns and used positive reenforment in order for them to learn better and keep playing the game (I added levels just so it wasnt super boring for people above the age of 6, although i wouldnt play it in my free time).
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>The hardest part was thinking like a young child. For us it is hard to see how this game would be interesting but if you are just learnign about shapes an matching this would be a very fun game to play.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> modified assets from online

			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Competative game, addrenlaline.
