		<h2>Quick Maths</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Originality:</strong> I modified a lot of the graphics from base templates i found online. The other originality that i added is that you have to spell out the food you want to serve the customers. thus combing learning with a fun game for
				kids.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> blind typing to get the food you want in a diner dash kinda game.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>The hardest part was keeping track of what letter i am on and to calculate the closest customer
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> modified assets from online

			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> Diner dash and learn to spell/type games for kids

			</li>

			<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> type to serve as many customers as you can in the given time
			</li>

			<li><strong>Theme:</strong> Sandwich
			</li>

			<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> I have not made a game like this yet (diner dash)
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> see if kids enjoy the game or if it is too hard for them
			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Learn new words while having fun
			</li>

			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> players ask customers what they want to have with SPACEBAR. <br>Then they go over the bar and type the name of that item <br>finally they go back to the customer and deliver the food with the ENTER Key
			</li>

			<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> type fast and dont forget
			</li>

			<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> you are a bartender serving customers. as many as you can until the store closes for the night
			</li>

			<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>Kids who are learning to type and spell
			</li>

			<li><strong>Play Time:</strong> 150 seconds
			</li>
