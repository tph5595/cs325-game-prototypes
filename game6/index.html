		<h2>Quick Maths</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Originality:</strong> I modified a lot of the graphics from base templates i found online. The other originality that i added is that have to memorize or react quickly to what you see on the screen and do quick maths.
				kids.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> quick math memorization game with a hot/cold method with squirrels.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>The hardest part was getting the timing on the screen right to achieve the desired level of difficulty.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> modified assets from online

			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> Do not know of any game like this. (Maybe math kids games??)

			</li>

			<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> guess the right number to get more points
			</li>

			<li><strong>Theme:</strong> N/A (It was optional)
			</li>

			<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> I have not made a game like this yet
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> See if the flow is correct with the concept
			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> Competative game, addrenlaline.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Player sees a multiplication problem (number of nuts) appear on the screen.
				<br>They guess what the answer was with the arrow keys (up and down to +/- 1, left and right to -/+ 10)
				<br>They hit SPACEBAR to lock in answer
				<br>Squirrels estimate how close you were (more the better, 10 max)
				<br>You then get one more guess (Same mechanic as before for selecting and locking in)
				<br>The real answer is shown and points are given (more points for closer guesses, - points for over 50 away)
				<br>Hit ENTER to move to next round
				<br>
				<br>    0 points -> Lose
				<br> 1000 points -> Win
			</li>

			<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> Look fast and dont forget
			</li>

			<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> Help the squirrels prepare for the winter by collecting enough nuts to survive.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>Kids who love fast paced games and want to get better at math estimations
			</li>

			<li><strong>Play Time:</strong> 120 seconds
			</li>
