		<ul>
			<li><strong>Originality:</strong> I modified a lot of the graphics from base templates i found online. I also can up with the idea of changing characters in order to be able to attack diffrent types of enemies.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> Switching between 2 heros in the survival game.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong> The hardest part was teh whole thing. i knew nothing of phaser before this so i had to learn the whole API form scratch.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> modified assets from online

			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> nothing to be knowledge. I came up with the idea on my own and only borrowed extremly small sections of code from other places (beside the template-gamestate in this repo).

			</li>

			<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> See how long you can last fighing off the herds of chickens.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Theme:</strong> person that is really a robot and chicken
			</li>

			<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> I have not made a survival game yet.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> See if swithcing between two characters is a viable game aspect
			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> high addrenaline rush and wanting to push for a higher and higher score.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> players switch between two characters using the enter key. then they use the space bar to shoot bullets that are the same color as they are. bullets can only kill an enemy of the smae color. movement is achieved using the
				arrow keys. the try to get the highest score by killing as manyt chickens as they can before they die.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> teleporting to the other side of the screen. the screen wraps around. purposely not stated. the palyer must figure this out
			</li>

			<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> In this world you are a plumer who is secretly a robot. you fight as the robot against the evil chicken army but one day the chickens find your true idenity adn they come after you so you must change your apperance
				to kill the different types of attacking chickens in order to survive.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>I am tryign to reach highly competitive people aroudn the age of 15-22 who already play video games on the regular and are looking for a new challenge.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Play Time:</strong> it can last as short or as long as possible. its a skill based game. most likley around 2 minutes though.
			</li>
