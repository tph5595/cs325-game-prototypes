		<ul>
			<li><strong>Originality:</strong> I modified a lot of the graphics from base templates i found online. I also can up with the idea of changing characters in order to be able to attack diffrent types of enemies.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong> Switching between 2 heros in the survival game.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong> The hardest part was teh whole thing. i knew nothing of phaser before this so i had to learn the whole API form scratch.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong> modified assets from online

			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong> Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
				<ul>
					<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><strong>High Concept:</strong> A one-sentence summary of your game.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Theme:</strong> State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong> State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong> What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
			</li>

			<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong> What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
			</li>

			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe
				game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Strategies:</strong> What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
			</li>

			<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong> A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory,
				mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
			</li>

			<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Play Time:</strong> How long does your game take to play?
			</li>
